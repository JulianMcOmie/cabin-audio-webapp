# Music Library Component Refactoring

## Overview

This refactoring breaks down the large `music-library.tsx` file (663 lines) into smaller, more maintainable components. The components are organized in a structured folder hierarchy.

## Folder Structure

```
/components/music-library/
  ├── index.ts                  # Exports all components
  ├── MusicLibrary.tsx          # Main component (refactored)
  ├── EQStatusAlert.tsx         # EQ status and settings
  ├── TrackItem.tsx             # Individual track display
  ├── EmptyLibrary.tsx          # Empty state view
  ├── ImportArea.tsx            # Drag-and-drop import area
  ├── ui/                       # UI-specific components
  │   ├── LoadingSkeleton.tsx   # Loading state skeleton
  │   ├── DragDropArea.tsx      # Drag and drop wrapper
  │   └── DragOverlay.tsx       # Overlay shown during drag
  └── animations.css            # Extracted animations
```

## Component Responsibilities

1. **MusicLibrary**: Orchestrates the overall library functionality, managing state and coordination between components
2. **EQStatusAlert**: Displays EQ status and provides a settings button
3. **TrackItem**: Renders a single track with play/pause controls
4. **EmptyLibrary**: Shows empty state with import instructions
5. **ImportArea**: Provides a drag-and-drop area for importing files
6. **LoadingSkeleton**: Shows loading placeholders
7. **DragDropArea**: Wraps content with drag-and-drop event handlers
8. **DragOverlay**: Displays an overlay during file drag

## File Size Reduction

- Original file: 663 lines
- Refactored main component: ~200 lines (70% reduction)

## Usage

The refactored component is used exactly like the original component:

```jsx
import { MusicLibrary } from "@/components/music-library";

export default function Home() {
  // ...
  return (
    <MusicLibrary
      setCurrentTrack={handleSetCurrentTrack}
      setIsPlaying={setIsPlaying}
      eqEnabled={eqEnabled}
    />
  );
}
```

## Benefits

- **Improved maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Better code organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality
- **Easier testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Enhanced reusability**: Components like TrackItem can be reused elsewhere
- **Simpler debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific components

## Future Improvements

- Further decompose the MusicLibrary component
- Add unit tests for each component
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Consider using React Context for state management
