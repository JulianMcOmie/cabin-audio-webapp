# Cabin Audio Web App Integration Design

## Overview

This document outlines the integration plan for connecting the backend services and data layers with the existing UI components. The implementation follows a layered architecture and a modular phased approach, focusing primarily on track management for v1.

1. **UI Layer**: React components and pages
2. **Hook Layer**: React hooks that provide functionality to UI components
3. **Store Layer**: Zustand stores for state management
4. **Storage Layer**: IndexedDB for local data storage

## Existing Component Analysis

To ensure proper integration, we must reference and utilize the existing components as defined in the design document. Below is a summary of the existing components and their expected locations:

### Store Layer Components

The following stores are already implemented as specified in the design document:

```
/lib/store/
  index.ts              # Combined store exports
  playerStore.ts        # Audio playback state
  libraryStore.ts       # Music library state (includes tracks)
  eqStore.ts            # EQ settings state
  authStore.ts          # Authentication state
  syncStore.ts          # Synchronization state
```

### Data Models

The following data models are already defined:

```
/lib/models/
  Track.ts              # Track data model
  Album.ts              # Album data model
  Artist.ts             # Artist data model
  Playlist.ts           # Playlist data model
  EQProfile.ts          # EQ profile data model
  EQBand.ts             # EQ band settings
  SyncRecord.ts         # Synchronization record
```

### Storage Services

The following storage services manage data persistence:

```
/lib/storage/
  indexedDBManager.ts   # IndexedDB interface
  fileStorage.ts        # Audio file storage
  metadataStorage.ts    # Track metadata storage
```

### Audio Engine Components

The following audio components handle playback and processing:

```
/lib/audio/
  audioContext.ts       # AudioContext singleton
  audioPlayer.ts        # Audio playback
  eqProcessor.ts        # EQ processing
  audioRouting.ts       # Audio routing
```

### Synchronization Components

The following components manage data synchronization:

```
/lib/sync/
  syncManager.ts        # Sync orchestration
  entitySync/
    trackSync.ts        # Track synchronization
    albumSync.ts        # Album synchronization
    artistSync.ts       # Artist synchronization
    playlistSync.ts     # Playlist synchronization
    eqSync.ts           # EQ profile synchronization
```

## Interface Compatibility Analysis

To ensure proper integration, we need to align the interfaces from the integration design with those from the design document.

### Track Interface

**Design Doc Interface**:
```typescript
interface Track {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artistId?: string;
  albumId?: string;
  duration: number;
  trackNumber?: number;
  year?: number;
  genre?: string;
  storageKey: string;  // IndexedDB key
  coverStorageKey?: string;
  lastModified: number;
  syncStatus: 'synced' | 'modified' | 'pending' | 'conflict';
}
```

**Integration Requirements**:
- Components must use this Track interface from `/lib/models/Track`
- UI needs to handle the optional fields appropriately
- Components should display the syncStatus when relevant

### PlayerState Interface

**Design Doc Interface**:
```typescript
interface PlayerState {
  currentTrackId: string | null;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  duration: number;
  volume: number;
  isMuted: boolean;
  loadingState: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'decoding' | 'ready' | 'error';
  loadingProgress: number; // 0-100 percentage for tracking file loading
  error: string | null;
}
```

**Integration Requirements**:
- Components should respect and utilize all loading states
- UI should properly visualize loading progress
- Error handling should use the error field appropriately

### Toast Interface

**Note about Toast Interface**:
Based on linting errors in the MusicLibrary component, the toast interface uses `variant` instead of `type`:

```typescript
interface ToastOptions {
  message: string;
  variant: 'success' | 'error' | 'info';  // NOT 'type'
  duration?: number;
  onDismiss?: () => void;
}
```

All UI components need to use this correct interface when showing toast notifications.

## Hook Architecture Overview

Hooks are the primary way components will interact with application state and backend services. The following hooks are already implemented or need to be implemented based on the existing infrastructure:

### 1. useToast

**Location**: `/components/common/ToastManager.tsx`

**Purpose**: Provides toast notification functionality throughout the application.

**Required Interface Adjustment**:
```typescript
// Change this:
showToast({ message: 'Message', type: 'success' })

// To this:
showToast({ message: 'Message', variant: 'success' })
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
const { showToast } = useToast();

// Show success notification
showToast({ 
  message: 'Track imported successfully', 
  variant: 'success' 
});

// Show error notification
showToast({ 
  message: 'Failed to import track', 
  variant: 'error' 
});
```

### 2. useFileImport

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/useFileImport.ts`

**Purpose**: Manages file import state and process, including drag-and-drop functionality.

**Integration with Existing Services**:
- Should use `fileStorage.ts` for storing audio files 
- Should use `metadataStorage.ts` for extracting and storing track metadata
- Should connect to `libraryStore` to update the track list

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  isImporting,
  importProgress,
  currentFile,
  dragActive,
  error,
  handleDragEnter,
  handleDragLeave,
  handleDragOver,
  handleDrop,
  handleFileSelect,
  cancelImport,
  clearError
} = useFileImport();

// Attach to import area
<div
  onDragEnter={handleDragEnter}
  onDragLeave={handleDragLeave}
  onDragOver={handleDragOver}
  onDrop={handleDrop}
>
  {/* Import area content */}
</div>
```

### 3. usePlayer

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/usePlayer.ts`

**Purpose**: Controls audio playback, track selection, and player state.

**Integration with Existing Services**:
- Should connect to `playerStore` state 
- Should use `audioPlayer.ts` for playback control
- Should connect to `audioRouting.ts` for output control

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  isPlaying,
  currentTrackId,
  currentTrack,
  isLoading,
  loadingState,
  error,
  playTrack,
  setPlayState,
  resetPlayer,
  next,
  previous,
  volume,
  setVolume,
  isMuted,
  setMuteState,
  currentTime,
  duration,
  seekTo
} = usePlayer();

// Play a specific track
playTrack('track-id-123');

// Set play/pause state
setPlayState(true);

// Adjust volume
setVolume(0.8);
```

### 4. useTrackStore

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/useTrackStore.ts`

**Purpose**: Provides access to the track data store.

**Integration with Existing Services**:
- Should connect to `libraryStore` for track data
- Should use `metadataStorage.ts` for metadata operations

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  tracks,
  isLoading,
  error,
  getTrack,
  getAllTracks,
  addTrack,
  updateTrack,
  deleteTrack,
  loadTracks
} = useTrackStore();

// Get all tracks
const allTracks = getAllTracks();

// Get a specific track
const track = getTrack('track-id-123');

// Add a new track
addTrack(newTrack);
```

### 5. useDataLoading

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/useDataLoading.ts`

**Purpose**: Manages loading data from storage into the application state.

**Integration with Existing Services**:
- Should use `indexedDBManager.ts` for database operations
- Should connect to all relevant stores to update application state

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  isLoading,
  error,
  loadData,
  clearError,
  retry
} = useDataLoading();

// Load data on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  loadData();
}, [loadData]);

// Handle loading states within component
```

### 6. useSyncManager (Phase 5)

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/useSyncManager.ts`

**Purpose**: Manages synchronization with the mock backend.

**Integration with Existing Services**:
- Should connect to `syncStore` for sync state
- Should use `syncManager.ts` for orchestrating sync operations

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  syncStatus,
  lastSyncTime,
  pendingChanges,
  error,
  sync,
  clearError
} = useSyncManager();

// Trigger sync manually
<button onClick={sync} disabled={syncStatus === 'syncing'}>
  Sync Now {pendingChanges > 0 ? `(${pendingChanges})` : ''}
</button>
```

## Component-Specific Integration Requirements

### MusicLibrary Component (`components/music-library.tsx`)

**Current Interface**:
```typescript
interface MusicLibraryProps {
  eqEnabled: boolean;
  setActiveTab: (tab: "eq" | "library" | "export" | "desktop" | "mobile" | "profile") => void;
  onSignupClick: () => void;
}
```

**Integration Changes**:
- Use `useTrackStore` for track data instead of local state

- Should show current file being processed
- Should allow cancellation of import

## Modular Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: UI Components and Interfaces

âœ… **Completed**

This phase defined the interfaces for UI components and established the visual states and interactions. The UI components now need to be connected to the backend services.

### Phase 2: Core Track Management Integration

This phase connects the UI components to the track management functionality. To ensure proper implementation and testing, we've broken this phase into smaller subphases:

#### Phase 2.1: Track Store Connection

âœ… **Completed**

This subphase connected UI components to the existing track data store functionality.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Verified useTrackStore hook connects properly to libraryStore for track data
- Implemented core functionality: getAllTracks, getTrack, and other track operations
- Added error handling and loading states
- Connected MusicLibrary component to use the track store for data

#### Phase 2.2: File Import Enhancement

âœ… **Completed**

This subphase improved the file import process to work with the track store, allowing us to test the track state functionality with real imports.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Enhanced useFileImport hook with metadata extraction functionality
- Connected import completion to track store updates
- Implemented drag-and-drop process with progress indicators
- Added error handling with toast notifications
- Integrated with track storage to update library UI after successful imports

#### Phase 2.3: Player Integration

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**

This subphase directly connects UI components to the playerStore for consistent playback state management.

**Core Integration Concept**:
The goal is simple: Replace the current prop-based communication between components with direct access to the shared playerStore. Both the MusicLibrary and PlayerBar components should:
1. Read playback state directly from usePlayerStore
2. Update playback state directly through usePlayerStore actions

**Specific Integration Tasks**:

1. **PlayerBar Component**:
   - Remove props for receiving track and playback state
   - Use usePlayerStore() directly to access currentTrackId, isPlaying, etc.
   - Call store actions directly: setCurrentTrack(), setIsPlaying(), etc.
   - Display loading states from playerStore.loadingState
   - Show progress based on playerStore.loadingProgress

2. **MusicLibrary Component**:
   - Remove props for setting track and playback state
   - Use usePlayerStore() directly to access currentTrackId and isPlaying
   - Call store actions directly when tracks are selected
   - Update TrackItem rendering based on playerStore state

3. **Page.tsx Modifications**:
   - Remove local state for currentTrack and isPlaying
   - Remove state setter functions passed to MusicLibrary and PlayerBar
   - Remove any state management logic related to playback
   - Components will now communicate through the playerStore instead of through page.tsx

4. **Remove Unnecessary Abstraction**:
   - Do NOT create a redundant usePlayer hook that just wraps usePlayerStore
   - Access the store directly in components: const { currentTrackId, isPlaying } = usePlayerStore()
   - Call actions directly: usePlayerStore.getState().setCurrentTrack(trackId)

**Verification Steps**:
- Play/pause in PlayerBar updates state in MusicLibrary and vice versa
- Track selection in MusicLibrary updates the PlayerBar
- Loading states are properly displayed in both components
- Volume and other controls work consistently
- Page.tsx no longer manages any playback state

**Expected Result**:
- Both components share the same playback state
- UI is consistent across the application
- No unnecessary abstraction layers
- Direct and simple integration with the existing stores
- Page.tsx is simplified with no playback state management

#### Phase 2.4: Toast Integration

This subphase implements the toast notification system now that we have a better understanding of the error and success scenarios from prior integrations.

**Integration Tasks**:

1. **Fix Toast Interface Usage**:
   - Update all toast calls to use `variant` instead of `type`
   - Ensure ToastManager is properly included in the application layout

2. **Enhance Error Handling with Toasts**:
   - Replace console logging with toast notifications
   - Add appropriate error messages for track loading failures
   - Implement success feedback for track operations
   - Ensure error details are displayed clearly

3. **Test Toast Functionality**:
   - Verify success, error, and info toasts display correctly
   - Confirm automatic dismissal works as expected
   - Test manual dismissal functionality

**Verification Steps**:
- Trigger various toast types from different components
- Verify styling is correct for each toast variant
- Confirm that toasts stack properly when multiple are displayed
- Check that duration settings are respected
- Test error scenarios and verify helpful messages are displayed

### Phase 3: Local Storage Implementation

This phase connects the application to IndexedDB for persistent data storage.

**Integration Tasks**:

1. **Storage Manager Integration**:
   - Connect `useFileImport` to `fileStorage.ts`
   - Integrate `useTrackStore` with `metadataStorage.ts`
   - Ensure proper initialization of IndexedDB

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Implement or connect to `useDataLoading` hook
   - Add loading indicators throughout the application
   - Handle storage errors appropriately

3. **Import Persistence**:
   - Update file import to store files in IndexedDB
   - Extract and store metadata for imported files
   - Update library display after import

**Expected Result**:
- Data persists between sessions
- Files are properly stored in IndexedDB
- Track metadata is extracted and stored
- UI reflects the persistent state

### Phase 4: Basic Playback Controls

This phase implements basic track playback functionality.
